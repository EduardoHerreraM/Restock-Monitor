# Restock-Monitor

I have created a script for a restock monitor. Right now it is having some issues with proxies. I am trying to improve it and add more sites like adidas, supreme, nike, etc but I can't do much anymore because of school. If you can make improvements and fix problems please do so. I know there is another GitHub project out there that has many non shopify sites and it would be cool if I could incorporate that.

Run: Go to sneakermonitor>sneakermonitor>spiders and then find the monitor python file. Thats the file you will be running.
In python to run the file type "python monitor.py" and press enter.

Hey! I have written a script for a restock monitor. I have finished it but the proxies are not working for me, the format for the proxies are in parentheses (IP:Port:User:Password). It would be great if someone could help me. I am looking to add more features to the script. The monitor runs 24/7 that can catch restocks as soon as possible when stock is loaded onto a website, when a product page is available, and automatically, with the most minimal delay possible, send that information (The Item Loaded and the corresponding link) to to my discord or slack channel. I would also love for it to be configurable so that I am able to add in additional sites (100+ Shopify, adidas, Supreme and many more.) I would also love to be able to filter what gets shown on the Discord Channel (keywords possibly) as I don't want to get spammed with an obnoxious amount of information from stock loading on the websites I would like to track. I want to also add proxy’s so I won’t get banned from the site. This information is very important to users that resell sneakers and they need the most up-to-date information about a site loading stock on the backend that is available on the front end, or just having an early link to purchase from before everyone else.

I also I have script that is a shopify bot that I would like to include. It will be labled "Shopify Bot"

The "sneaker-notify-master" is the GitHub project I was talking about at the beginning.

ANYONE THAT IS WILLING TO HELP WILL BE PAID!!!!!!
